# AOC 2024 in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code problems implemented in Rust. Input files for all days should be placed in `input/`. Running `cargo run --release` will output results for all days, but you can also do `cargo run --release -- -d n` to execute day `n`. 2025 is executed by default, but you can execute 2024 with `cargo run --release -- -y 2024`

There is also a simple benchmark flag, `-b`. This can be applied to all days via `cargo run --release -- -b` or a single day via `cargo run --release -- -bd n`.
